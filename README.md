# DCompute

DCompute is a decentralised "Scientific Computation as a Service" platform that uses cutting edge technologies like blockchain and web assembly to beat the increasing costs of cloud computing in COVID times due to high load on cloud providers and global silicon shortages which inhibit access to virtual machines and local compute at a cheap rate. Scientists and researchers can upload their code on our platform and its then compiled to a WASM binary through our service for other nodes on the network to process and be rewarded for in exchange for their hardwork and resources in form of Celo Cryptocurrency.

## Start Instructions

to run the wasm backend do the following:

```
cd wasm
npm run install && npm start
```

to run the react app do the following

```
cd react-app
yarn install && yarn start
```

## Tech-Stack

- Firebase (for database)
- React (for frontend)
- Web Assembly
- Celo developer SDK and web3 (for implementing payments)
- NodeJS (for WASM compilation)
- Lotte Files (for 2D animations)
- ThreeJS and WebGL (for 3D animations)
- TailwindCSS (for styling)
- Figma (for designing)

## Social Problems Solved

- COVID-19 has disrupted supply chains in numerous industries.
- Computer manufacturing facilities are running at fractional capacity.
- Cloud data centres are witnessing their biggest upsurge ever.
- GPUs and TPUs are in short supply, just like the silicon that's needed to manufacture them.
- you can use the latent processing power among the different machines connected to the network and use it for intensive computations at lightning speed.
- Task binaries can be served over the internet and can be run on any machine in exchange for cryptocurrency.
- Optimised binaries can run orders of magnitudes faster than interpreted scripts. WASM wasn't a possibility a few years back. But its a global web standard now.
- This can save researchers and scientists a lot of time and money as they can decentralise their workload without having to worry about monopolistic cloud providers or outages.
- More compute power coming online can help accelerate the research for noble causes like COVID-19 cure development.

## Applications

- Scientists and researchers who want to run long running computation workloads but can't afford expensive cloud computers or don't want to deal with the complexity that cloud providers bring.
- Cryptographers or mathematicians who want to run long calculations on computers but don't have access to them.
- People with powerful laptops or GPUs who are willing to help others in exchange for a reward.
- Anyone who wants to decentralise computational services and wants to contribute towards COVID-19 research.

## Future

- Currently, DCompute supports WASM generation through Assembly Script. In future, support for more methods like C++ or Rust.
- Support for conventional payments apart from Celo can also be added through Razorpay.
